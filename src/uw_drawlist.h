/* The draw-list executor -- rast_execute and the opcode handlers
 * the shipped lists use.
 *
 * A UW frame's 3-D view is a PROGRAM. The game builds a list of 16-bit
 * opcodes per frame, one per tile and per object, and the rasteriser threads
 * through it: every handler ends `lodsw; xchg ax,bx; jmp [bx+0x2738]`, so
 * the next opcode word is a BYTE OFFSET into a dispatch table and there is
 * no loop at all. The table is filled in at run time.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. Everything under it -- the vertex fetch, the
 * rotate, the slot opcodes, the clip, the projection, both texture mappers
 * -- is ported. This is the thing that drives them: a frame's own draw
 * list executed against its own tables.
 *
 * WHAT IT COVERS. Every opcode the shipped lists use,
 * the rotate set rast_select_rotate_set installs, the near-wall subdivision,
 * both texture mappers and the lighting pass over them. Three opcodes --
 * emit_sprite (0x3a), emit_creature (0x5a) and automap_mark (0xb0) -- and
 * the shaded untextured faces reach paths outside this module (the sprite
 * blitter, the creature pager, the automap, rast_draw_shaded), and are
 * COUNTED AND SKIPPED rather than guessed at, so a frame comparison can say
 * what it did not draw.
 *
 * TWO COORDINATE ORDERS LIVE IN THIS INSTRUCTION SET, and they are not the
 * same one twice. A VERTEX's three list words are x, z, y -- the fetch
 * writes BX, BP, CX and the rotate reads BX, CX, BP. An ORIGIN's three are
 * x, y, z: set_origin subtracts them from the three camera words in that
 * order, and rast_origin_patch then writes them into the fetch's three
 * `sub ax,imm` immediates BY ADDRESS -- the first takes origin x, the
 * second origin z, the third origin y -- which is where the two orders are
 * reconciled.
