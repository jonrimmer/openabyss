/* uwshell -- the port run as a program: a window, a clock, a keyboard and a
 * mouse over the dungeon frame, tick and panels, in the original's own pass.
 *
 * THE WINDOW is resizable, 4:3 by default -- the frame scaled up four times
 * with nearest sampling and stretched to 320 x 240 with a filtered one, as
 * a VGA monitor showed mode 13h -- or square with --square; Alt-Enter
 * toggles full screen; vsync unless --no-vsync; --pace sets a pass's least
 * length. A button down in the 3-D view holds the pointer until the
 * buttons are up, the motion then added to the cursor as the driver's
 * deltas are, so a walk cannot run the pointer out of the window.
 *
 * THE GAME'S FILES are found as --dir, else $UW_DATA, else the working
 * directory when it has DATA/, else the one the build names
 * (UW_GAME_DIR_FALLBACK), and
 * refused, with what is missing named, unless DATA/, CRIT/ and CUTS/ are
 * there (check_game_directories). THE SOUND PLAYS BY DEFAULT -- the music
 * through the port's AdLib model and the cutscenes' voices through its
 * digital one -- where the original takes both from DATA/UW.CFG's drivers
 * and a copy INSTALL never configured names none. --nosound silences it;
 * --sound is on regardless, a restored game's own switches included.
 *
 *     uwshell [--dir DIR] [--saves DIR] [--scale N] [--sound|--nosound] ...
 *
 * A development harness can drive the program through the hooks in
 * uwshell.h -- a script, a staged new game, a saved memory image, dumps and
 * traces; built with UW_NO_HARNESS there is none, and the hooks do nothing.
 *
 * THE MODES. game_loop is one loop for every game mode, and
 * which handlers a pass runs is a table: event_handlers[mode][event]
 * (three rows, indexed as game_set_mode maps the mode number --
 * 2 to 1, 4 to 2, everything else to 0), with [mode][0] the enter handler
 * and [mode][15] the leave handler that game_change_mode runs around a
 * change. The shell keeps the same shape: `modes[]` below is a row a mode,
 * each with its pass and its leave, dispatched on the mode the game is in
 * (uw_shell.mode: 1 the dungeon, 2 the automap, 4 a conversation, and the
 * character generation screen, which in the original is new_game's own
 * loop before game_loop and here is a mode of the shell's). What the
 * original runs as a loop MODAL inside a click handler -- scroll_text_input's
 * "Move how many? " and options_menu_loop -- is not a mode, and runs as an
 * overlay on whatever mode is up (modal_pass).
 *
 * THE PASS in the dungeon is game_loop's: event_dispatch runs the dungeon
 * mode's handlers in event order for the bits pending -- 1 the view refresh
 * (dungeon_refresh_view, rendered through src/uw_scene.c and presented by
 * uw_motion_view_present), 3 the pending teleport, 9 the inventory refresh,
 * 11 the frame, 12 the tick, 13 the panels -- re-arms the standing mask
 * 0x3800, runs the cursor bounds countdown; then input_tick
 * polls one source, keyboard or mouse in turn, and delivers a
 * key to input_dispatch_key or a click to the hotspot table. A handler's
 * button-release wait (mouse_button_released -1) keeps the passes running
 * without input until the button is up, when the wait's rest runs.
 *
 * THE CLOCK is the 256 Hz counter the game reads through clock_ptr, here
 * SDL's nanoseconds from the first state's frame stamp on. THE KEYBOARD is
 * the driver's key state array: a byte a scan code, set while a key is down,
 * which the frame reads for the movement keys and keyboard_scan_held
 * round-robins for the bound keys, 0x1e ticks apart, through
 * key_char_table. THE MOUSE is cursor_update_position's move and the cursor
 * interrupt's click latch: a press with nothing pending latches the cursor's
 * position and the button mask, which mouse_read delivers on the
 * release, or the live mask while a button stays down. */
