/* The fades and the screen transitions, the one
 * thing every ported screen asked for and none of them had.
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ARE CALLED A FADE HERE, and the original keeps them
 * apart:
 *
 *   palette_fade_out and palette_fade_in ramp the
 *   DAC. Nothing on the screen is touched; every pixel keeps its index and
 *   the colours those indexes mean go to black and come back. That is what
 *   dungeon_draw_main_screen runs, two steps each way.
 *
 *   screen_fade_out and screen_fade_in rewrite the
 *   VIEW. They are screen_wipe_forward and screen_wipe_backward driving
 *   gfx_remap_buffer_shaded over the work buffer -- thirteen passes of
 *   LIGHT.DAT's rows 0..12 -- and then a clear to colour 0xf1, which
 *   PALS.DAT's palette 0 makes black. The panels around the view are not
 *   touched. That is what perform_pending_teleport and
 *   player_sleep run.
 *
 * WHAT A PORT MUST DO DIFFERENTLY. Both fades are loops with a wait and a
 * present inside them, and neither is the host's to run: the original
 * spins on the clock at [0x2364] for eight ticks a frame (palette) or
 * leans on screen_present's own pacing (view). So both are steppers here --
 * the caller runs a frame, presents it, and comes back. That is the same
 * shape the shell already drives a button-release wait with.

 * stops when its index reaches zero, so byte 0 of the work buffer is never

 * compound, each row applied to what the row before it left.

 * A fade out through rows 0..12 of the retail LIGHT.DAT takes the view's
 * mean luminance from 23.0 to 7.3 and leaves the 44 colours the ramp
 * fixes; a fade in walks 12 down to 1 over the image that is coming back.
