/* THE OPTIONS PANEL as the program runs it: options_menu_loop
 * and its pages, save_game and
 * save_or_restore_slot -- over the ported writers and readers
 * (uw_motion_save_player_dat, uw_motion_level_save, uw_motion_restore) and
 * the files a save is: SAVEn/PLAYER.DAT, LEV.ARK, BGLOBALS.DAT and DESC.
 * For the shell (src/tools/uwshell.c).
 *
 * The original's loop is modal inside the options button's click: its
 * pages draw OPTBTNS.GR's images over the action buttons' column -- a
 * background 35 x 108 at (4, 0xbd) and a 31 x 14 row image at (5, 0xbb -
 * (6 - row) * 15), the highlighted variant the next image -- and it polls
 * the input: Return activates the highlighted row, Escape closes, Space
 * and the keypad's up step the highlight up and its down keys step it
 * down, and a click's row is (y - 0x52) / 15 of the cursor in the panel.
 * Here the session keeps the state between the shell's passes: the shell
 * feeds it keys and clicks and asks `active`. A save asks the scroll for
 * a description (scroll_text_input: `typing`), then writes the slot's
 * four files and reloads the player; a restore reads them and rebuilds
 * the game as savegame_restore_progress does, and `restored` tells the
 * shell to redraw the dungeon screen and re-enter the level. */
