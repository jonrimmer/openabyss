/* A SCENE: the game's memory for drawing the 3-D view, assembled from the
 * shipped files alone, and a draw that runs the whole renderer over it.
 *
 * What the original has in memory when view_render runs, and where this gets
 * it:
 *
 *   6aac  the data segment       UW.EXE's image; COMOBJ.DAT at 0x5b6e;
 *                                 ALLPALS.DAT at 0x573e; TERRAIN.DAT's floor
 *                                 kinds for the level at 0x7192; the level
 *                                 and object pointers; the player's position,
 *                                 heading and record; SHADES.DAT's record for
 *                                 the light level; the detail setting as
 *                                 set_render_detail patches it
 *   5723  the rasteriser         UW.EXE's image (the model programs and
 *                                 handler tables ship in it); gr_load_all's
 *                                 image tables and crit_pages_init's creature
 *                                 tables; the camera program's depth scale
 *   4963  the graphics module    UW.EXE's image; the light ramp from SHADES
 *   6624  the private segment    UW.EXE's image, whose view-state block the
 *                                 camera port fills
 *   EMS   the image pool         gr_load_all's packing of the .GR files and
 *                                 gr_load_door_textures' door textures
 *   level segment                LEV.ARK's level block: tiles at +4, mobile
 *                                 objects from +0x4004, static from +0x5b04
 *   texture slots                W64/F32/W16/F16.TR by the level's texture map
 *
 * and a draw is view_place_camera, view_setup_frame, view_build_light_map,
 * view_traverse_spans and view_build_draw_list (src/uw_viewlist.c,
 * uw_viewspan.c), then rast_execute's setup (uw_rastframe.c) and the list run
 * through the executor (uw_drawlist.c) into the caller's buffer.
 *
 * WHAT A FIRST DRAW IS NOT. The executor's memory carries state from frame
 * to frame -- the shader and polygon words, the shape records, the slot
 * window -- and the original's first frame after loading ran over whatever
 * came before. uw_scene_draw therefore runs the list once before the frame it
 * returns, the first time. One warm-up reaches the steady state except
 * where a list inherits a polygon count no list of its own writes (one
 * detail-1 scene). */
